# AgriSmart: Intelligent Crop Recommendations Using Data Science

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Farmers often struggle to decide which crops are best suited for their farms due to varying environmental and soil conditions. This project aims to create a predictive model that analyzes factors like temperature, humidity, soil pH, rainfall, and nutrient content (N, P, K) to recommend the most suitable crops. By using machine learning, the goal is to provide accurate and actionable insights, helping farmers make informed decisions, increase crop yields, and improve overall farm productivity.

<h2>Why I Developed This Project</h2>
I created this project to help farmers make better decisions about which crops to grow. Traditional farming methods often rely on guesswork, but with this data-driven tool, farmers can choose crops based on their specific soil and environmental conditions. By using machine learning, the project simplifies decision-making, saves resources, and improves crop yields, directly benefiting farmers and agricultural advisors.

<h2>Who It Is Useful For</h2>
<b>Farmers:</b> Seeking data-driven tools to make precise crop selection decisions and optimize farming practices.<br>
<b>Agricultural Consultants:</b> Advising farmers on maximizing productivity and resource efficiency.<br>
<b>Government and NGOs:</b> Supporting sustainable agriculture initiatives and ensuring food security.<br>
<b>Agricultural Researchers:</b> Exploring the application of machine learning in agriculture and precision farming.<br>
<b>Agri-tech Companies:</b> Developing innovative solutions for modernizing farming techniques.

<h2>Outcome:</h2>
Delivered actionable insights for investors with limited stock analysis experience, facilitating data-driven investment decisions and reducing decision-making time by 25%.

<h2>Key Deliverables:</h2>

Cleaned and processed stock datasets, integrated data using SQL, developed comprehensive visualization charts, created three interactive dashboards, and prepared a PowerPoint presentation explaining each chart. The project saved approximately 40 hours in manual data analysis and visualization, and provided stakeholders with a tool that could potentially save thousands of dollars by reducing investment risks.
